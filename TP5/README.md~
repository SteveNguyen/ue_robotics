# TP5

**In the following TPs, you'll use the tools acquired during the previous classes on
 a robotic hexapod in order to create a walking gait. In this
 particular TP, you'll check the mechanical integrity of your robot,
 and you'll configure the robot in order to begin the walking gait development **

1. Set up a simple demonstration of your inverse kinematic
implementation. 15 min max.

2. You'll be given an Hexapod, tighten each screw, verify the
connections. Do not underestimate Murphy.

3. Set the correct ID for each one of the 18 motors

4. Go to the pypot's documentation page and read about the
'autodetect_robot' functionality and the JSON dumping system. Then
make it work for your robot

5. How would you do to make your hexapod walk? Research, discuss and
conquer the world.
