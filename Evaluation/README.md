# Evaluation

** The day of the evaluation you'll be asked to demonstrate the
   behaviors your robot can execute. Each group will have ~10 minutes
   to do so and answer a few questions. A mark will be given to the
   group, but keep in mind that the final mark is individual as it heavily
   takes into account the continuous evaluation.  **

** Warning : **
   Not using the inverse kinematics for the validation of a
   behavior is a crime. Your mark will be 0, and you might even get
   fined.

** Note : **
   Originality is absolutely encouraged, arriving to the evaluation with interesting
   behaviors or approaches can only be good for you.

** Mandatory behaviors : **
   - Moving an arbitrary leg to an arbitrary (x, y, z) position
   - Moving the center of the robot to an arbitrary (x, y, z) position
   (the 6 legs staying on the floor)
   - Walking in a straight line
   - Rotating without moving the center of the robot

** Advanced behaviors : **
   - Controlling the robot with a keyboard/mouse/whatever
   - Walking X mm in a straight line (odometry)
   - Rotating theta degrees (odometry)
   - Walking in a straight line in any direction without rotating
   (holonomic robot)
   - Variable movement speed
   - Legs move smoothly
   - The robot can change its direction on the go

** A few fun ideas : **
   - Attaching a pen to a leg and draw something with it
   - Making the spider dance to the rythm of an arbitrary (i.e. not
   predetermined) song
