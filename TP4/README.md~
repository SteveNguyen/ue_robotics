# TP2

**The aim of this TP is to use the pypot library to communicate with the motors**

1. Be sure to have pypot properly installed (cf. ![The first README](https://github.com/SteveNguyen/ue_robotics/blob/master/README.md "README") and http://poppy-project.github.io/pypot/installation.html)
2. Test (and understand) the example program 
3. Change the motors positions to 10°, 20° and 30°
4. Write a loop to make the motors follow a sinusoid of frequency 0.5Hz and amplitude 10° centered at 0°.
  You need to use numpy.sin(), numpy.pi and time.time()
5. Write a generic function to change a motor id and change the ids of your motors to 10,11,12.

**NOTE:**

Everything you need to use in pypot is documented here:
